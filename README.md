# GoobalSlimeWorld
a KSP planet mod featuring a homeworld in a horseshoe orbit with respect to a habitable-zone gas giant, 

Developed by Luna Rose & Eaurp Guz.

Goobal Slime World adds the Zwo-nmu system, home to the goobals, astronauts made out of Mystery Goo. The planet mod is built at 1/4th of real scale, so compared to RSS scale delta-v costs are cut in half and compared to stock KSP delta-v costs are about 1.6x higher.

The home of the Goobals, Gymnome, is a half-earth-mass planet in a horseshoe orbit with respect to the Jupiter-mass gas giant Omen. Over the course of 30 years, it shifts between a low, warm, fast orbit and a high, cool, slow orbit. It encounters the gas giant Omen every approximately 15 years, whereupon the planet reaches an angular size of about 1/10th of a degree. Gymnome has no moons, so all space exploration will be interplanetary.

## Mod requirements.

### Principia
Goobal Slime World must be played using Principia, a mod that adds n-body gravitation. The horseshoe orbit central to the mod is categorically impossible with patched conics. This will require a fairly steep learning curve if you are used to the patched conics approximation, but ultimately principia's trajectory planning tools are more powerful than those available in stock KSP.

Principia can be found here: https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia

In addition, the following mods are required:
* Kopernicus: https://github.com/kopernicus/kopernicus/releases
* Kopernicus Expansion Continued: https://github.com/VabienArt/KopernicusExpansion-Continueder/releases
* VertexHeightOblateAdvanced: https://github.com/jamespglaze/VertexHeightOblateAdvanced/releases

There is also compatibility for the following mods:
* Scatterer: https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/releases
* TextureReplacer: https://github.com/ducakar/TextureReplacer/releases/


## System Layout.

The above image compares the Solar System to the Zwo-Nmu system at RSS scale. The thickness of Omen's orbit line is comparable to the variance in Gymnome's orbit. Inclination and eccentricity is not considered in the above diagram.

The horseshoe orbit of Gymnome with respect to an Omen rotating reference frame. In reality, Gymnome is in a mostly circular orbit around the star, Zwo-nmu, only changing its orbit during the span of months near the Omen close approach.

Goobals are Gymnomi Slime who take on the appearance of a large-headed, small-bodied humanoid. Though the sentient inhabitants of Gymnome take lots of different shapes and sizes, goobals are launched into space due to their small mass and high adaptability. Like most Gymnomi, most Goobals are genderless. (Though feel very free to imagine that individuals with other genders, bodyplans, are actually flying on the rockets--we just can't depict this in game)

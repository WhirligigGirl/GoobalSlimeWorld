	//PrincipiaKillSwitch = False
	//not implemented yet, will set the system to a fallback state where binaries are replaced with moons, and Gymnome becomes a simple Omen trojan.
	
	//ScalePreset = QuarterScale
	//not implemented yet.
	//choose between "QuarterScale", "RealZwoNmuSystem", "StockalikeScale".
	//QuarterScale (1/4th RSS, 2.5x stock; default) is balanced well for historical rocket parts mods balanced to match stock mass ratios and thrusts. Delta v is ~1.6x stockalike and exactly 1/2 of RSS scale.
	//RealZwoNmuSystem (RSS scale, 10x stock), is balanced for SMURFF (a part rebalance config) or for Realism Overhaul. Planets are their true sizes. Makes Eaurp Guz happy.
	//StockalikeScale (1/10th RSS Scale), is for an experience comparable to stock or other stock scale KSP Mods, although since Gymnome is only half the mass of Kerbin at this scale, it's honestly too easy.
	
	KronometerMode = QScale_9Hours
	//Sets which Kronometer patch is used.
	//QScale_9Hours: Day length = mean solar day on Gymnome. Year is 390 times longer than that, nearly the mean Omen year. The days are split into 9 hours, each into 60 minutes and seconds. //0.9766157407407405 seconds per real second.
	//QScale_Seximal: Gymnomi Slimes split the day into 36 hours... at quarter scale they will do so with merely 18 hours. They use base 6 divisions of the hour, for 36 nifths per hour and 1296 ntamnoths per hour or 36 ntamnoths per nifth. 1.35641075 ntamnoths per second.
	//QScale_Earth: 12 hours per half an earth day, 360 half-earth-days per half-earth-year. No relation to the actual astronomy of the ZwoNmu system. If you want 24 hour time, uninstall Kronometer and switch to 24 hour time in your game settings.
	//RZMS_18hours: Real Scale ZwoNmu System mode: 18 hours per day.
	//RZMS_Seximal: Gymnomi Slimes split the day into 36 hours, 36 nifths per hour, and 36 ntamnoths per nifth. 1.35641075 ntamnoths per second.
	//Stockalike: for StockalikeScale. 5.5 hours per Gymnome day, 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute, 1.00814737 seconds per real second.
	//One day I'd like to include a totally different calendar which uses the month functionality for years of differing lengths, and counts the omicycle as well as year and day... but that would be a lot of work.

			description = Gymnome is our own home planet, upon which you are likely to currently be sitting, laying, or resting in a little puddle. Gymnome is a coorbital companion of Omen, and when it approaches Omen, the much more massive planet twists Gymnome's path around Zwo-Nmu into a higher or lower orbit, drastically altering its climate. That's why we have to migrate every 15 years or so, to avoid desertification and hyper-monsoons in the hot years and frigid glaciation in the cold years.

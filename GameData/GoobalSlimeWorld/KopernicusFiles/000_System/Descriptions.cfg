//Nomenclature:
//sun: informal synonym for Zwo-Nmu or for stars at the centers of planetary systems.
//Zwo-Nmu: Formal name for the central star.
//Planet: a gravitationally rounded object that is not massive enough for hydrogen fusion to occur.
//Satellite Planet: a planet that orbits another planet.
//Secondary Planet: synonym for Satellite Planet.
//Planetoid: a natural celestial body too small to be gravitationally rounded.
//Minor Planet: synonym for Planetoid.
//Quasisatellite: A planet or planetoid which orbits a common parent object with another planet or planetoid, in such a way that one appears to move around the other.
//Coorbital: A planet that shares the same mean orbital period as another.

//Off limits:
//Asteroid: too specific to earth astronomy history, though this is essentially synonymous with Planetoid.
//Moon: references the Moon, a solar system object named for its ability to measure the length of the month. (moon, month, measure, and meter all share a root). 
//      Gymnome lacks a notable satellite so they would not use "moon" as a shorthand for natural satellites.
//Dwarf Planet: The IAU definition of a planet can not apply to the Zwo-Nmu system, since Gymnome is both clearly a major planet and also would be counted as a dwarf planet under the IAU. Therefore, dwarf planet is not a useful category. Similarly, the IAU says planets orbit the Sun, but Gymnomi have seen planets orbiting Omen since antiquity, so their archaic definition of planet as wandering star would include satellites.

			%description = Zwo-Nmu, named for an ancient Gymnomi word for "day light," is the sun at the nominal center of the Zwo-Nmu planetary system. It is a G8V Main Sequence Star, making it larger and hotter than most stars, but still very much a dwarf star compared to some of the more massive stars visible in the night sky. Zwo-Nmu is about 136 times larger than Gymnome and more than 600,000 times more massive, and comprises 99.5% the mass of the entire system. \n\n Zwo-Nmu is thought to have accreted from a massive cloud of gas and dust, with the planets having formed in an accretion disk. Zwo-nmu is primarily composed of Hydrogen and Helium, the lightest and most common elements in the universe. However, it is relatively metal-rich compared to other stars of its age, with a metallicity of about 2%.

	@Body[Omen]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Omen is the third most massive celestial object in the Zwo-Nmu system, but it is probably the celestial body that holds the most cultural significance. Omen appears large and bright in the night sky year-round, outshining all stars except Zwo-Nmu, but for about 6 months every 18 years or so, Omen appears so bright that it can cast shadows at night. An apparition of Omen signals changing climate, hence the name. See also: Gymnome entry. \n\n Omen is nearly 200 times the mass of Gymnome, and like Zwo-Nmu and Glerbuh, it is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Gymnome has four large satellite planets, which can be easily seen during Omen Apparitions: Spark, Lake, Oldsky, and Rival, as well as a small handful of minor satellite planetoids.

	@Body[Spark]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Spark is the innermost of the Ominous Planets, with an orbital period of about a day and a half. Modern telescopic observations show a world with ongoing volcanism, but its name is actually a reference to its appearance as it goes in and out of Omen's shadow. Spark appears to be a rocky world with a high density, but with such a close-in orbit it seems unlikely that it could have been captured. Better understanding Spark could give clues to how Omen's satellites formed, and whether Omen formed in place or migrated inward from the outer solar system.
		}
	}
	@Body[Lake]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Lake, so named for its blue color, is the second Ominous Planet, with an orbital period of about three days, or twice that of Spark's. Lake appears much like Omen, and probably like Gymnome appears from space: a blue sphere with turbulent systems of white cloud cover. The nature of the white material on Lake has been debated since telescopic observation of it became possible. It can not be solid continents, both since its density is much lower than a rocky planet and since the white material moves around over time, but it was thought that it could be either glaciers moving around with water currents, or water vapor clouds in the atmosphere. Since Lake's temperature is not yet known, it is unclear which it is, or if it might be both clouds and ice.
		}
	}
	@Body[Oldsky]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Oldsky is the largest Ominous Planet (unless you count Gymnome). Oldsky appears very similar to Gymnome, with a blue global ocean and a supercontinent on one hemisphere, though it appears to be lifeless, with only brown-white and red-orange desert covering all of the land. Oldsky orbits Omen retrograde, and is thought to have been a captured primary planet. Oldsky should have started out with a highly eccentric orbit which should have led to the inner satellites of Oldsky becoming unstable, which either implies that Spark and Lake are secondarily accreted satellites (unlikely, since Lake has too much water to have formed in the inner Zwo-Nmu system), or that Oldsky had a very gentle capture (possibly very early on, mediated by gas drag in a circumplanetary accretion disk).
		}
	}
	@Body[Wanderer]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Wanderer is a small planetoid orbiting Omen startlingly close to Oldsky's orbit. Since Oldsky is in a retrograde orbit and Wanderer orbits prograde, the two objects meet more than twice an orbit, thus any orbital perturbations tend to get cancelled out. Nevertheless, Wanderer's orbit does precess and shift over time, and the long term stability is unknown. It is expected that some time in the next few hundred thousand to millions of years it could collide with Oldsky. Tidal forces slowly drag Oldsky inward and Wanderer outward. Since the two objects probably can not have crossed orbits without colliding, Wanderer must have been a recently captured planetoid from either one of the planetoid belts or from the Omen coorbitals.

	}
	@Body[Rival]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Rival is the most distant Ominous Planet. It's named Rival since, during Omen apparitions, its brightness and ruddy color rivals that of the brilliant red giant star Rodocer. It's smaller than Oldsky and Gymnome, but its apparently rocky composition indicates it's most likely a captured Primary Planet like Oldsky, although it does orbit prograde. The gentle capture of not just one but two major primary planets raises questions about whether Rival really is a captured satellite, or if it was formed around Omen and somehow survived the capture of Oldsky. Rival appears to be a dry desert planet with a very thin atmosphere, but glints of sunlight reflecting off of dark flat regions indicate that some of its craters might have liquid water.

	}
	@Body[Temma]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = 1729 Temma is a temporary quasisatellite of Gymnome. It orbits the sun, but it appears to orbit Gymnome once a year. It was discovered shortly after the previous Omen apparition, apparently having caught itself in Gymnome's gravity well at just the right time. However, during the next Omen apparition at time of writing, Temma will be destabilized by the giant planet's gravity, and it will begin to move away. Eventually, Omen's gravity is expected to launch Temma out into the gap between Glerbuh and Omen. Its fate beyond the next few decades is uncertain, though we certainly hope that, as large as it is, it won't endanger Gymnome.

	@Body[Kerbin]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Gymnome is our own home planet, upon which you are likely to currently be sitting, laying, or resting in a little puddle. It is a diverse world with several major clades of multicellular life, comprising Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, and Gymnomycota (the latter of which includes Gymnomycozoans such as yourself), spread across 7 or 8 continents and a globe-spanning ocean and such diverse biomes as deserts, steppe, rainforests, and slamps (slime swamps).\n\n Gymnome is the largest coorbital object of Omen, and sometimes considered an 'honorary' Ominous Planet. Gymnome and Omen both orbit Zwo-nmu with the same mean period, but gravitational interactions change Gymnome's orbit significantly over time. Starting from a high orbit, Omen pulls ahead until it catches up to Gymnome. Its gravity pulls back on Gymnome's orbit, causing it to move to a lower, faster orbit. About 19 years later Gymnome catches up to Omen again, and Omen pulls the planet forward, giving it more orbital energy, and causing it to move to a higher, slower orbit. This has drastic effects on Gymnome's climate. Over the course of the Omicycle, as Gymnome traces out a 'horseshoe' shape with respect to a rotating Omen reference frame, the planet gets several degrees hotter and cooler. That's why we all have to migrate every couple of decades, and why the Ominous Parties are so intense.

	@Body[Glerbuh]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Glerbuh is the Zwo-Nmu system's most massive planet, over three times the mass of the already very remarkable Omen. Named for an ancient deity of time, it has the longest orbital period of the classically recognized planets, at 10.8 mean Gymnome years. Glerbuh is very noticeably squished when magnified, thought to be a consequence of the planet's rapid rate of rotation. The most skilled eye-magnifiers were able to report this prior to the invention of the optical telescope. However, telescope users are treated to another more unique sight, if the sides of the lenses and the inside of the telescope are well-blackened: Glerbuh has a faint nebulous ring circling it, best visible when Glerbuh is moved just outside the field of view of the instrument. Detecting it with photographic film has proven difficult, but Gymnomi retinal film has a better dynamic range. Glerbuh has a dozen or so small satellite planets and planetoids, and it's thought that meteoric impacts between the satellites could be responsible for the faint ring.

	@Body[Glarpi]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Glarpi is the first planet to be discovered, that was not known since antiquity. It was independently discovered a few times by pre-telescopic astronomers, and mistaken to be small comets or even stationary stars. When the technique of eye magnification was discovered, astronomers shapeshifted their eyes into increasingly large objective lenses, and many new discoveries were made this way, and more precise measurements of the position of the little comet could be made. Philosophers disagreed over whether the object was a comet or a planet. The object appeared small, bluish, and fuzzy, like comets or nebulae. By the time the Laws of the Motions of the Planets had been discovered, the object was shown to be on a similar circular orbit to the the other planets, and it appeared on maps as a "Planet of Cometary Character." The first telescopic observation of the object by Leige Glarpi Jallorp, with a 7cm glass refractor, confirmed it was not a persistent comet at all, but had indeed been a planet all along. Magnification using biological shapeshifting was prone to optical aberrations that made Glarpi appear blurry, when in reality it was a sphere just like the other planets.  Leige Glarpi's preferred name for the planet was Slarmock's Star, after their emporer, but as Slarmock was planning war in the region this became very unpopular. Various other names were floated around, including the names given to it by previous generations of astronomers, but eventually the scientific community settled on Glarpi, after its discoverer, laying nomenclatural precedent for many planetary discoveries to come.

	@Body[Shpler]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Shpler is visible to the unaided eye, and quite easily seen to an occular shapeshifter, but thanks to its slow orbit it was completely missed until after the invention of the glass telescope. The planet was discovered with a speculum metal reflector telescope of 15cm diameter by a centauriform laborer named Wallan Shpler. Almost immediately upon its detection it made an impression on Wallan as being unlike any object they had ever seen, appearing as a blue disk adorned with a brilliant white concentric circular ring. Wallan struggled to get their detection published as no one had much patience for a peasant with a telescope made of trash. At last jan Yer, an astronomer of the timekeeping observatory in a nearby port decided to observe Shpler's object, and it made both them and Shpler famous immediately. The astronomical community intended to name the planet Yer, but jan Yer wouldn't allow Wallan Shpler's name to fall to obscurity. The planet Shpler is much larger than Gymnome, but smaller than Omen, being about 30 Gymnome masses. It is circled by a ring which is thought to be an orbiting accretion disk of small particles of reflective ice. During Shpler equinoxes, where the rings are nearer to the line of sight, spectroscopic observations have been undertaken to show that the rings are made of particles in circular orbits around Shpler. During Shpler solstices, when the ring is tilted nearly face-on, concentric gaps within the rings can be clearly seen, likely the result of gravitational interactions with Shpler's satellite planetoids.

	@Body[Eauah]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Eauah was the third outer planet to be discovered, and although an occular shapeshifter did once incorrectly observe it as a star prior to the invention of the telescope, its discovery is attributed to the mathematician Oodysa Yiggleglath Eauah, who determined that Glarpi and Shpler's orbits were weakly perturbed by an additional planet. Eauah's predicted orbit was highly eccentric and inclined, and they also computed that the planet would eventually cross the orbit of Glarpi and cause a catastrophic rearrangement of the cometary population that would doom the entire Zwo-Nmu system to cometary rain. Eauah's prediction raised alarm, leading to an international project to attempt to locate the planet. Attempts to discover it in historical observations failed, but three observatories were able to observe the planet within a night. Eauah's prediction of the planet's position was spot on, but its orbit turned out to be stable and roughly circular. Despite this astronomical overreaction, the planet bears their name. (Mainly because none of the observatory staff could agree which observatory actually detected the planet first.) Eauah has the slowest rotation period of all of the outer planets. It remains to be determined if this is a tidal effect, or the result of a more cataclysmic event.

	@Body[Flibul]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Flibul is the smallest of the outer planets, and was the first outer planet to be discovered on a photograph. After the embarassing overreaction to Eauah, Oodysa Eauah reconsidered the measurements they had made of Glarpi and Shpler, and determined the source of errors in their calculations. However, even accounting for those, they still could not reproduce the observed orbit of planet Eauah. It remained a mystery for many years until observations of Eauah's orbit also began to diverge from predictions. Odyssa again proposed that a fourth outer planet could match the data, but they were old and could not do the work themself. The work was undertaken instead by an undergraduate astronomy student named Yasblorb, who computed the orbital parameters of the additional planet. The planet was discovered on existing photographic plates by another undergraduate astronomy student named Eugigath. Enough photographic data existed to allow for an orbit solution, and their professor, Flibul, got time on the campus observatory to search for the planet. Flibul was the subject of a legal battle over its official name, as Eugigath insisted the discovery was theirs and wanted naming rights. (Yasblorb had no interest in naming credit.) Although the court sided with Eugigath, the astronomical community had already begun using the name Flibul. Flibul is only 6 Gymnome masses, comparable to Cool Ember, and its small diameter made it easy to miss. Long exposure photographs of Flibul have revealed faint rings. Some models of the formation of the four outer planets suggest they could have formed from giant impacts between icy objects, which then accreted hydrogen-helium atmospheres. In this hypothesis, Flibul could be a planetecimal, and close observation could shed light on how the ice giants formed.\n\n Glarpi, Shpler, and Eauah share an orbital resonance chain of 8:5 and 4:3. Flibul is close to, but not exactly at, the 3:5 resonance with Eauah, resulting in a resonance chain of 32:20:15:9. For every 32 orbits of Glarpi around Zwo-Nmu, Shpler orbits 20 times, Eauah orbits 15 times, and Flibul orbits 9 times. This pattern repeats about once every 1,560 years.

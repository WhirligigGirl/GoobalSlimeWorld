			description = Glerbuh is the Zwo-nmu system's most massive planet, over three times the mass of the already very remarkable Omen. Named for an ancient deity of time, it has the longest orbital period of the classically recognized planets. Glerbuh has a unique nebulous ring visible to astronomers who place Glerbuh just outside of the field of view of a telescope that has had its lenses and interior properly blackened. It is thought to be a shared atmosphere belonging to Glerbuh's many moons.
